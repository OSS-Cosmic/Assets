# Adding New Textures

If new textures to be added, please make sure we have to proper rights & licences to use and redistribute the assets.

A few things to consider:
 - Add license and credits information to each texture set you download
 - Make sure you put a link somewhere in a readme file


We use [CG Bookcase](https://www.cgbookcase.com/textures/), [Texture Haven](https://texturehaven.com/textures/?c=all) and [CC0Textures](https://cc0textures.com) to get the assets.
